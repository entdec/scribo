## Future ideas

- Based on 'name' and children content allow automatic content_for (content-part functionality)
    - Name must be unique per parent_id
    
    - /contact - page - layout: contact (with sidebar, body and address sections)
        - sidebar - content
        - body - content
        - address - content 
        
- Add content-part, replacing part of the content model, possibly making above first idea easier.
