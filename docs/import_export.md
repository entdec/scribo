# Importing and exporting

Scribo allows you to easily import and export sites, 
if you want to work with the content outside the web-based maintenance.

Importing and exporting is done using zip files, which contains one zipped site.
All content in the zip will be in a folder with the same base-name as the zip.  

## Meta information 
The files in the zip are annotated using json files, which contain meta information encoded.
The JSON files have the same name as the normal file name, but start with `._`
