# IDE
The IDE provides you with two main areas, the explorer on the right and the code editor on the right.

## Explorer
The explorer shows all files and folders in the site. The explorer allows you to do the following:
- add files or folders, by clicking the 'New file' of 'New folder' icon
- rename files or folders, by double clicking on a file or folder name
- reorder files or folders by dragging them.
- add new files to your site by dragging files onto the tree

## Code editor
The code editor allows you to edit files. It provides syntax highlighting.
